# 🤖 Machine Learning Project – Jupyter Notebook Based

This repository contains a complete machine learning project built and documented using Jupyter Notebook. It showcases the end-to-end pipeline of a data science workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — ideal for learning or internship showcase.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 📈 Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
- 🧪 Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)  
- 📉 Data visualization with matplotlib / seaborn  
- 📂 Final report (`Ai Project.pdf`)  
- 📓 Executable notebook file (`ML_Project.ipynb`)
